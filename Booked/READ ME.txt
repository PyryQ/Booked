 This is a small Book library API that connects to a SQLite database.
 Launching the program will open a Swagger page that lets you interact with all the possible endpoints. 
 The books.db database file is included in the program files.
 
 To view the code and lauch the Swagger it is recommended that you download the files and open the them with Visual Studio.
 Instructions on starting a program in general can be found here:
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/get-started/csharp/run-program?view=vs-2022
 
 Users can:
 
 - GET all the books with possibility to query using author, year or publisher.
 - GET book based on integer id.
 - POST new books with json object
 - DELETE books based on integer id
 
 
 Info on the books is the following:
 
“id": read only integer id, that works as an identifier
"title": mandatory title text
"author": mandatory aurtor text
"year": mandatory integer publishing year
"publisher": mandatory publisher text
"description": optional description text



TODO and improvements.

- Add constraint to the database that checks if book with same title, author and year excists. Now this is checked only in API.

- Implement logging

- Add more comprehensive filter options to SQL string while featching the products.

- Some nice easy way of lauching the swagger page
