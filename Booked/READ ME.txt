 This is a small Book library API that connects to a SQLite database.
 Launching the program will open a Swagger page that lets you interact with all the possible endpoints. 
 The books.db database file is included in the program files.
 
 To view the code and lauch the Swagger it is recommended that you download the files and open the them with VS-studio.
 
 Users can:
 
 - GET all the books with possibility to query using author, year or publisher.
 - GET book based on integer id.
 - POST new books with json object
 - DELETE books based on integer id
 
 
 Info on the books is the following:
 
“id": read only integer id, that works as an identifier
"title": mandatory title text
"author": mandatory aurtor text
"year": mandatory integer publishing year
"publisher": mandatory publisher text
"description": optional description text



TODO and improvements.

- Add constraint to the database that checks if book with same title, author and year excists. Now this is checked only in API.

- Implement logging

- Add more comprehensve filter options to SQL string while featching the products.

- Some nice launch
